\section{Methodology}
Wannier90 computes Maximally Localised
Wannier Functions (MLWFs) following the method of Marzari and Vanderbilt (MV).\footnote{
{\it Maximally localized generalized Wannier functions for composite energy bands}
N. Marzari and D. Vanderbilt, Phys. Rev. B 56, 12847 (1997)}
For entangled energy bands  the method of
Souza, Marzari and Vanderbilt (SMV)\footnote{{\it Maximally localized
    Wannier functions for entangled energy bands} 
I. Souza, N. Marzari and D. Vanderbilt, Phys. Rev. B 65, 035109 (2002)}
is used.
We briefly introduce the methods and key definitions, but full details
can be found in the original papers. 

First principles codes typically solve the electronic structure of
periodic materials in terms of Bloch states, $\psi_{n{\bf k}}$. 
These extended states are characterised by a band index $n$ and crystal
momentum ${\bf k}$. An alternative representation can be given in terms
of spatially localised functions known as Wannier functions (WFs). The WF 
centred on a lattice site ${\bf R}$,  $w_{n{\bf R}}({\bf r})$, 
is written in terms of the set of Bloch states as
\begin{equation}
w_{n{\bf R}}({\bf r})=\frac{V}{(2\pi)^3}\int_{BZ} \left[\sum_{m} U^{({\bf
k})}_{mn} \psi_{m{\bf k}}({\bf r})\right]e^{-\mathrm{i}{\bf k}.{\bf R}} d{\bf k},
\end{equation}
where $\bf{U}^{({\bf k})}$ is a unitary matrix that mixes the Bloch
states at each 
${\bf k}$. $\bf{U}^{({\bf k})}$ is not uniquely defined and different choices
will lead to WFs with varying spatial localisations. We define the
spread $\Omega$
of the WFs as 
\begin{equation}
\Omega=\sum_n \left[\langle w_{n{\bf 0}}({\bf r})| r^2 | w_{n{\bf
      0}}({\bf r}) \rangle - | \langle w_{n{\bf 0}}({\bf r})| {\bf r} | w_{n{\bf
      0}}({\bf r}) \rangle |^2 \right].
\end{equation}
The total spread can be decomposed into a gauge invariant term
$\Omega_{\rm I}$ plus a term ${\tilde \Omega}$ that is dependant on the gauge
choice $\bf{U}^{({\bf k})}$. ${\tilde \Omega}$ can
be further divided into terms diagonal and off-diagonal in the WF basis,
$\Omega_{\rm D}$ and $\Omega_{\rm OD}$.
\begin{equation}
\Omega=\Omega_{\rm I}+{\tilde \Omega}=\Omega_{\rm I}+\Omega_{\rm D}+\Omega_{\rm OD}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{{\rm I}}=\sum_n \left[\langle w_{n{\bf 0}}({\bf r})| r^2 | w_{n{\bf
      0}}({\bf r}) \rangle - \sum_{{\bf R}m} \left| \langle w_{n{\bf R}}({\bf r})| {\bf r} | w_{n{\bf
      0}}({\bf r}) \rangle \right| ^2 \right]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{\rm D}=\sum_n \sum_{{\bf R}\neq{\bf 0}} |\langle w_{n{\bf R}}({\bf r})| {\bf r} |
w_{n{\bf 0}}({\bf r}) \rangle|^2 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{\rm OD}=\sum_{m\neq n} \sum_{{\bf R}} |\langle w_{m{\bf R}}({\bf
  r})| {\bf r} |
w_{n{\bf 0}}({\bf r}) \rangle |^2 
\end{equation}
The MV method minimises the gauge dependent spread $\tilde{\Omega}$ with respect the set
of $\bf{U}^{({\bf k})}$ to obtain MLWFs.

The Wannier90 code requires two ingredients from an initial electronic structure calculation.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The overlaps between the cell periodic part of the Bloch states $|u_{n{\bf k}}\rangle$ 
\begin{equation}
M_{mn}^{(\bf{k,b})}=\langle u_{m{\bf k}}|u_{n{\bf k}+{\bf b}}\rangle,
\end{equation}
where the vectors ${\bf b}$, which connect a given k-point with its neighbours, are determined
by the Wannier90 code according to the prescription outlined in MV.
\item As a starting guess the projection of the Bloch states
  $|\psi_{n\bf{k}}\rangle$ onto trial localised orbitals $|g_{n}\rangle$ 
\begin{equation}
A_{mn}^{(\bf{k})}=\langle \psi_{m{\bf k}}|g_{n}\rangle,
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
Note that $\bf{M}^{(\bf{k,b})}$, $\bf{A}^{(\bf{k})}$ and
$\bf{U}^{({\bf k})}$ are all 
small, $N_{{\rm wann}}\times N_{{\rm wann}}$ matrices, independent of
the basis set used to obtain the original Bloch states.  

To date the Wannier90 code has been
used in combination with electronic codes based on plane-waves and
pseudopotentials (norm-conserving and ``ultrasoft'') as well as mixed
basis set techniques such as FLAPW. 

\subsection{Entangled Energy Bands}
The above description is sufficient to obtain Wannier functions for an
isolated set of bands, such as the valence states in an insulator. In
order to obtain MLWFs for entangled energy bands we use the
``disentanglement'' procedure introduced in SMV.

We define an energy window (the ``outer window''). At a given
k-point $\bf{k}$, 
$N^{{\bf k}}_{{\rm win}}$ states lie within this energy window. We
obtain a set of 
$N_{{\rm wann}}$ Bloch states by performing a unitary
transformation amongst the Bloch states which fall within the energy window at each k-point:
 \begin{equation}
| u_{n{\bf k}}^{{\rm opt}}\rangle = \sum_{m\in N^{{\bf k}}_{{\rm win}}}
U^{{\rm dis}({\bf k})}_{mn} | u_{m{\bf k}}\rangle
\end{equation}
where $\bf{U}^{{\rm dis}({\bf k})}$ is a rectangular $N_{{\rm
 wann}}\times N^{{\bf k}}_{{\rm win}}$
 matrix\footnote{As
    $\bf{U}^{{\rm dis}({\bf k})}$ is a rectangular matrix this is a unitary
    operation in the sense that $(\bf{U}^{{\rm dis}({\bf k})})^{\dagger}\bf{U}^{{\rm dis}({\bf k})}=\bf{1}$.}. The set of $\bf{U}^{{\rm dis}({\bf k})}$ are obtained by minimising
 the gauge invariant spread $\Omega_{{\rm I}}$ within the outer energy
 window. The MV procedure can then be used to minimise $\tilde{\Omega}$
 and hence obtain MLWF for this optimal subspace.

It should be noted that the energy bands of this
optimal subspace may not correspond to any of the original energy
bands (due to mixing between states). In order to preserve exactly the
properties of a system in a given energy range (eg, around the Fermi
level) we introduce a second  energy window. States lying
within this inner, or ``frozen'', energy window are included unchanged
in the optimal subspace.
