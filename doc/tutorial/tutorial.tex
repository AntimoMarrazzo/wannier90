\section*{Preliminaries}

Welcome to \wannier! The examples contained in this tutorial are
designed to help you to become familiar with the procedure of
generating, analysing and using maximally-localised Wannier functions
(MLWF). As a first step, install \wannier\ following the
instructions in the {\tt README} file of the \wannier\ distribution.
For an introduction to the theory underlying MLWF, you are encouraged
to refer to the brief overview given in the \wannier\ User
Guide~\cite{UserGuide}, to the two seminal papers of
Refs.~\cite{MV,SMV}, and to a recent paper~\cite{W90} describing
\wannier.

The following additional programs should be installed in order to
visualise the output of \wannier\ 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt gnuplot} is used to plot bandstructures. It is 
available for many operating systems and is often installed by default on
 unix/Linux distributions\\
{\tt http://www.gnuplot.info}
\item {\tt xmgrace} may also be used to plot bandstructures.\\
{\tt http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace}
\item {\tt XCrySDen} is used to visualise crystal structures, MLWF,
  and Fermi surfaces. It is available for unix/Linux, 
  Windows (using cygwin), and OSX. To correctly display 
files from \wannier, version 1.4 or later must be used.\\
{\tt http://www.xcrysden.org}
\item {\tt vmd} can also be used to visualise crystal structures and
  MLWF.\\
{\tt http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd}
\end{itemize}



\section*{About this tutorial}

The first part of this tutorial comprises four examples taken from
Refs.~\cite{MV,SMV}: gallium arsenide, lead, silicon and copper. All
of the \wannier\ input files have been provided.

The second part of the tutorial covers the generation of \wannier\
input files starting from a full electronic structure calculation. We
have provided input files for the \pwscf\ ({\tt
  www.quantum-espresso.org}) interface to \wannier. Therefore, you
will need to install and compile elements of the {\tt
  quantum-espresso} package, namely {\tt pw.x} and {\tt
  pw2wannier90.x}, in order to run these
examples. Please visit {\tt www.quantum-espresso.org} to download the
package, and for installation instructions. 

At the time of
writing, interfaces to a number of other electronic structure codes,
such as {\sc 
  castep} ({\tt www.castep.org}), {\sc abinit} ({\tt
  www.abinit.org}), and {\sc fleur} ({\tt
  www.flapw.de}), are in progress.

For images of MLWF, see our gallery at {\tt
  http://www.wannier.org/gallery.html}. If you have any images that
  you would like to submit to the gallery, please email us.

\section*{1: Gallium Arsenide}

\begin{itemize}
\item{Outline: \it{Obtain and plot MLWF for the four valence
    bands of GaAs.}} 
\item{Generation details: \it{From \pwscf, using norm-conserving
    pseudopotentials and a 2$\times$2$\times$2 k-point grid. Starting
    guess: four bond-centred Gaussians.}}
\item{Directory: {\tt examples/example1/}}
\item{Input Files}
\begin{itemize}
\item{ {\tt gaas.win}  {\it The master input file}}
\item{ {\tt gaas.mmn}  {\it The overlap matrices $\Mkb$}}
\item{ {\tt gaas.amn}  {\it Projection $\Ak$ of the Bloch states onto a set
    of trial localised orbitals}} 
\item{ {\tt UNK00001.1}  {\it The Bloch states in the real space unit
    cell. For plotting only.}} 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Run \wannier\ to minimise the MLWF spread
{\tt
\begin{quote}
wannier90.x gaas
\end{quote} }
Inspect the output file {\tt gaas.wout}. The total spread converges to its
minimum value after just a few iterations. Note that the geometric centre of
each MLWF lies along a Ga-As bond, slightly closer to As
than Ga. Note also that the memory requirement for the minimisation of
the spread is very low as the MLWF are defined at each
k-point by just the 4$\times$4 unitary matrices $\Uk$. 
\item Plot the MLWF by adding the following keywords to
  the input file {\tt gaas.win} 
{\tt
\begin{quote}
wannier\_plot = true
\end{quote} }
and re-running \wannier. To visualise the MLWF we must
represent them explicitly on a real space grid (see
Ref.~\cite{UserGuide}). As a consequence, plotting the MLWF is slower
and uses more memory than the minimisation of the spread. The four
files that are created ({\tt gaas\_00001.xsf}, etc.) can be viewed
using XCrySDen,\footnote{Once XCrySDen starts, click on {\tt Tools}
  $\rightarrow$ {\tt Data Grid} in order to specify an isosurface
  value to plot.} e.g.,
{\tt
\begin{quote}
xcrysden --xsf gaas\_00001.xsf
\end{quote} }

For large systems, plotting the MLWF may be time consuming
and require a lot of memory. Use the keyword {\tt wannier\_plot\_list}
to plot a subset of the MLWF. E.g., to plot the
1st, 2nd and 7th MLWF use 
{\tt
\begin{quote}
wannier\_plot\_list = 1 2 7
\end{quote} }
The MLWF are plotted in a supercell of the unit cell. The
size of this supercell is set through the keyword {\tt
  wannier\_plot\_supercell}. The default value is 2 (corresponding to a
supercell with eight times the unit cell volume). We recommend not using
values great than 3 as the memory and computational cost scales
cubically with supercell size.  

Plot the 3rd MLWF in a supercell of size 3. Choose a low
value for the isosurface (say 0.5). Can you explain what you see? 

{\it Hint:} For a finite k-point mesh, the MLWF are in fact
periodic and the period is related to the spacing of the k-point mesh. For
mesh with $n$ divisions in the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ direction in the
Brillouin zone, the MLWF ``live'' in a supercell $n$ times the
unit cell. 
\end{enumerate}

\section*{2: Lead}

\begin{itemize}
\item{Outline: \it{Obtain MLWF for the four lowest states
    in lead. Use Wannier interpolation to plot the Fermi surface}}
\item{Generation Details: \it{From \pwscf, using norm-conserving
    pseudopotentials and a 4$\times$4$\times$4 k-point grid. Starting
    guess: atom-centred sp$^3$ hybrid orbitals}} 
\item{Directory: {\tt examples/example2/}}
\item{Input Files}
\begin{itemize}
\item{ {\tt lead.win}  {\it The master input file}}
\item{ {\tt lead.mmn}  {\it The overlap matrices $\Mkb$}}
\item{ {\tt lead.amn}  {\it Projection $\Ak$ of the Bloch states onto a set
    of trial localised orbitals}} 
\item{ {\tt lead.eig}  {\it The Bloch eigenvalues at each k-point. For
    interpolation only}} 
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
The four lowest valence bands in lead are separated in energy from the
higher conduction states (see Fig.~\ref{fig:pb-bnd}). The MLWF of
these states have partial occupancy. MLWF describing only the occupied
states would be poorly localised.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Run \wannier\ to minimise the MLWF spread
{\tt
\begin{quote}
wannier90.x lead
\end{quote} }
Inspect the output file {\tt lead.wout}.
\item Use Wannier interpolation to obtain the Fermi surface of
  lead. Rather than re-running the whole calculation we can use the
  unitary transformations obtained in the first calculation and restart
  from the plotting routine. Add the following keywords to the {\tt
    lead.win} file: 
{\tt
\begin{quote}
restart = plot

fermi\_energy = 5.2676

fermi\_surface\_plot = true
\end{quote} }
and re-run \wannier. The value of the Fermi energy (5.2676\,eV) was
obtained from the initial first principles calculation. \wannier\
calculates the band energies, through wannier interpolation, on a 
dense mesh of k-points in the Brillouin zone. The density of this grid is
controlled by the keyword {\tt fermi\_surface\_num\_points}. The default
value is 50 (i.e., 50$^3$ points). 
The Fermi surface file {\tt lead.bxsf} can be viewed using XCrySDen,
e.g.,
{\tt
\begin{quote}
xcrysden --bxsf lead.bxsf
\end{quote} }
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{lead}
\caption{Bandstructure of lead showing the position of the Fermi
  level. Only the lowest four bands are included in the calculation.} 
\label{fig:pb-bnd}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\section*{3: Silicon}

\begin{itemize}
\item{Outline: \it{Obtain MLWF for the valence and low-lying
    conduction states of Si. Plot the interpolated bandstructure}} 
\item{Generation Details: \it{From \pwscf, using norm-conserving
    pseudopotentials and a 4$\times$4$\times$4 k-point grid. Starting
    guess: atom-centred sp$^3$ hybrid orbitals}} 
\item{Directory: {\tt examples/example3/}}
\item{Input Files}
\begin{itemize}
\item{ {\tt silicon.win}  {\it The master input file}}
\item{ {\tt silicon.mmn}  {\it The overlap matrices $\Mkb$}}
\item{ {\tt silicon.amn}  {\it Projection $\Ak$ of the Bloch states onto a
    set of trial localised orbitals}} 
\item{ {\tt silicon.eig}  {\it The Bloch eigenvalues at each k-point}}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The valence and lower conduction states can be represented by MLWF
with sp$^3$-like symmetry. The lower conduction states are not 
separated from the higher states by an energy gap. In order to form
localised WF, we use the disentanglement procedure
introduced in Ref.~\cite{SMV}. The position of the inner and outer
energy windows are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:si.bnd}. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Run \wannier.
{\tt
\begin{quote}
wannier90.x silicon
\end{quote} }
Inspect the output file {\tt silicon.wout}. The minimisation of the
spread occurs in a two-step procedure~\cite{SMV}. First, we minimise
$\Omega_{\rm I}$ -- this is the extraction of the optimal subspace in
the disentanglement procedure. Then, we minimise $\Omega_{\rm D} +
\Omega_{{\rm OD}}$.

\item Plot the MLWF by adding the following commands to
  the input file {\tt silicon.win} 
{\tt
\begin{quote}
restart = plot

bands\_plot = true
\end{quote} }
and re-running \wannier. The files {\tt silicon\_band.dat} and {\tt
  silicon\_band.gnu} are created. 
To plot the bandstructure using gnuplot
\smallskip
{\tt
\begin{quote}
myshell> gnuplot

gnuplot> load `silicon\_band.gnu'
\end{quote} }
The k-point path for the bandstructure interpolation is set in the {\tt
  kpoint\_path} block. Try plotting along different paths. 
\end{enumerate}

\section*{4: Copper}

\begin{itemize}
\item{Outline: \it{Obtain MLWF to describe the states around the
    Fermi-level in copper}} 
\item{Generation Details: \it{From \pwscf, using ultrasoft
    pseudopotentials~\cite{USPP} and a
    4$\times$4$\times$4 k-point grid. Starting guess: five 
    atom-centred d orbitals, and two s orbitals centred on one of each
    of the two tetrahedral interstices.}}
\item{Directory: {\tt examples/example4/}}

\item{ {\tt copper.win}  {\it The master input file}}

    set of trial localised orbitals}} 
\item{ {\tt copper.eig}  {\it The Bloch eigenvalues at each k-point}}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Run \wannier\ to minimise the MLWF spread
{\tt
\begin{quote}
wannier90.x copper
\end{quote} }
Inspect the output file {\tt copper.wout}. 

\item Plot the Fermi surface, it should look familiar! The Fermi
  energy is at 12.2103\,eV. 

\item Plot the interpolated bandstructure. A suitable path in k-space is
\smallskip
{\tt
\begin{quote}
begin kpoint\_path

G 0.00  0.00  0.00    X 0.50  0.50  0.00

X 0.50  0.50  0.00    W 0.50  0.75  0.25

G 0.00  0.00  0.00    K 0.00  0.50 -0.50
 
end kpoint\_path
\end{quote} }
\item Plot the contribution of the interstitial WF to the
  bandstructure. Add the following keyword to {\tt copper.win}
\smallskip
{\tt
\begin{quote}
bands\_plot\_project = 6,7
\end{quote} }
The resulting file {\tt copper\_band\_proj.gnu} can be opened with
gnuplot. Red lines correspond to a large contribution from the
interstitial WF (blue line are a small contribution; ie a large `d' contribution).


\end{enumerate}




Investigate the effect of the outer and inner energy window on the
interpolated bands.

Inspect the output file {\tt copper.wout}. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use Wannier interpolation to obtain the Fermi surface of
  copper. Rather than re-running the whole calculation we can use the

  from the plotting routine. Add the following keywords to the {\tt
    copper.win} file:
{\tt
\begin{quote}
restart = plot

fermi\_energy = [insert your value here] 

fermi\_surface\_plot = true
\end{quote} }
and re-run \wannier. The value of the Fermi energy can be  
obtained from the initial first principles calculation. \wannier\
calculates the band energies, through wannier interpolation, on a
dense mesh of k-points in the Brillouin zone. The density of this grid is
controlled by the keyword {\tt fermi\_surface\_num\_points}. The default
value is 50 (i.e., 50$^3$ points).
The Fermi surface file {\tt copper.bxsf} can be viewed using XCrySDen,
e.g., 
{\tt
\begin{quote}
xcrysden --bxsf copper.bxsf
\end{quote} }


\item Plot the interpolated bandstructure. A suitable path in k-space is
\smallskip
{\tt
\begin{quote}
begin kpoint\_path

end kpoint\_path
\end{quote} }
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Further ideas}
\begin{itemize}
\item Compare the Wannier interpolated bandstructure with the full
  \pwscf\ bandstructure. Obtain MLWF using a more dense k-point grid.
\item Investigate the effect of the outer and inner energy window on
  the interpolated bands. 
\item Instead of extracting a subspace of seven states, we could extract a
  nine dimensional space (i.e., with s, p and d character). Examine this case
  and compare the projected bandstructures.

 To start with, we are going to obtain MLWF for the oxygen 2p
  states. From the bandstructure~\cite{BaTiO3}, these form an isolated
  group of bands. We use the \wannier\ keyword {\tt exclude\_bands} to
  remove all but the 2p bands from the calculation of the overlap
  and projection matrices (we don't have to do this, but it saves time).

the second MLWF.

The valence and lower conduction states can be represented by MLWF
with sp$^3$-like symmetry. The lower conduction states are not 
separated by an energy gap from the higher states. In order to form
localised WF we use the disentanglement procedure
introduced in Ref.~\cite{SMV}. The position of the inner and outer
energy windows are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:si.bnd}. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Modify the input file and run \pwscf\ and \wannier.\\
Inspect the output file {\tt silicon.wout}. The minimisation of the
spread occurs in a two-step procedure. First, we minimise $\Omega_{\rm

disentanglement procedure. Then, we minimise $\Omega_{\rm
  O}+\Omega_{{\rm OD}}$.

In order to form localised WF that describe both the occupied and
unoccupied $\pi$ and $\pi^{\ast}$ manifolds, we use the
disentanglement procedure to extract a smooth manifold of states that
has dimension equal to 2.5 times the number of carbon atoms per unit
cell~\cite{WanTran}. The positions of the energy windows are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:cnt.win}.

The part of the \wannier\ input file that controls the transport part
of the calculation looks like:

{\tt
\begin{quote}

transport\_mode           = bulk\\

\end{itemize}

The periodic system is contians two unit cells evenly distributed along the 
supercell. Transport calculations are performed using {\tt transport\_mode =
bulk} and so the resulting quantum conductance represents that of an infinite
periodic chain. 

The part of the \wannier\ input file that controls the transport part
of the calculation looks like:

{\tt
\begin{quote}
transport = true\\
transport\_mode = bulk\\
tran\_read\_ht = false\\
one\_dim\_axis = x\\
fermi\_energy = -2.7401\\
tran\_win\_min = -5.0\\

tran\_energy\_step = 0.01\\
translation\_centre\_frac = 0.5 0.5 0.5\\
tran\_num\_bb = 2

\end{quote} }

The defected system uses a 13 atom supercell with the central atom
position altered to break symmetry. Setting {\tt transport\_mode = lcr} with tell 
\wannier\ to treat the system as an infinte sytsem with the defect at its centre.
The supercell is chosen so that is conforms to the 2c2 geometry (see User Guide 
for details). Each principal layer is 2 atoms long so that the conductor 
region contains the defected atom plus a single atom on either side.

The transport section of the input file contians  these key differences:

{\tt
\begin{quote}
transport\_mode = lcr\\
tran\_num\_ll = 2\\
tran\_num\_cell\_ll = 2\\

\end{quote} }

First we consider a single unit cell, with 10 k-points. With 
{\tt transport\_mode = bulk} we compute the transport properties 
of a pristine, infinite, periodic (5,0) carbon nanotube. Later, we will 
compare the quantum conductance of this system with a defected

In this calculation a 11 atom supercell is used with a single silicon 
substitutional defect in the central unit cell. The supercell is chosen so that is 
conforms to the 2c2 geometry (see User Guide for details) with principal 
layers set to be 2 unit cells long.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Run \pwscf\ and \wannier. Again these are large calculations, progress
can be monitored by viewing respective output files.\\
\item The quantum conductance is written to {\tt cnt+si\_qc.dat}. 
Compare the quantum conductance with the periodic (bulk) calculation.

\item{ {\tt Si.win}  {\it The \wannier\ and \postw\ input file}}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

Note the first five steps in the following are the same of Example~11.
If you have already run Example~11 (in particular, the section ``\emph{Valence + Conduction States}'')
you can start from those files and continue from point 6, after adding the \bw\ flags to the
input file.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Run \pwscf\ to obtain the ground state of silicon\\
{\tt pw.x < Si.scf > scf.out}

\item Run \pwscf\ to obtain the Bloch states on a uniform k-point
  grid. Details on the disentanglement procedure are discussed in Example~11.\\ 
{\tt pw.x < Si.nscf > nscf.out}

\item Run \wannier\ to generate a list of the required overlaps (written
  into the {\tt Si.nnkp} file).\\
{\tt wannier90.x -pp Si}

\item Run {\tt pw2wannier90} to compute the overlap between Bloch
  states and the projections for the starting guess (written in the
  {\tt Si.mmn} and {\tt  Si.amn} files).\\
{\tt pw2wannier90.x < Si.pw2wan > pw2wan.out}

\item Run \wannier\ to compute the MLWF.\\
{\tt wannier90.x Si}

\item Run \postw\ to calculate the transport coefficients.\\
For serial execution use: {\tt postw90.x Si}  \\
For parallel execution use: {\tt mpirun -np 8 postw90.x Si} \\
Note that the {\tt mpirun} command-line flags may be different in your MPI implementation: read your MPI manual. You may also want to change the number of processors (8 in this example).

\end{enumerate}

Inspect the output file {\tt Si.wout} and check if the convergence was reached both in the
disentanglement and in the wannierisation steps (as discussed in further detail in Example~11).
You may also want to plot the Wannier functions and the interpolated band structure.

Inspect the output file {\tt Si.wpout}. It summarizes the main details of the calculation (more details can be obtained by setting a larger value of the \verb#iprint# flag). 
Check if no warnings are issued. Note that if no special flags are passed to \bw, it assumes that
the ab-initio calculation did not include magnetization effects, and thus it sets to 2 the
number of electrons per state.

Note also that the value of the relaxation time $\tau=10$~fs in the example is set only as an exemplificative value; note also that only the electrical and thermal conductivity depend on $\tau$, while the Seebeck coefficient is independent of $\tau$.

Using your favourite plotting program, plot the {\tt Si\_boltzdos.dat} file to inspect the DOS.

Using your favourite plotting program, plot columns 1 and 3 of the {\tt Si\_seebeck.dat} file to inspect the $S_{xx}$ component of the Seebeck coefficient as a function of the chemical potential $\mu$, at $T=300$~K.

\subsection*{Further ideas}

\begin{itemize}
\item Change the interpolation to a $60\times 60\times 60$ mesh and run again \postw\ to check if the results for the transport properties are converged. 

\item Change the {\tt Si.win} input file so that it calculates the transport coefficients for temperatures from 300 to 700~K, with steps of 200~K. Rerun \postw\ and verify that the increase in execution time is neglibile (in fact, most of the time is spent to interpolate the band structure on the $k$ mesh).

Plot the Seebeck coefficient for the three temperatures $T=300$~K, $T=500$~K and $T=700$~K. To do this, you have to filter the {\tt Si\_seebeck.dat} to select only those lines where the second column is equal to the required temperature. A possible script to select the $S_{xx}$ component of the Seebeck coefficient for $T=500$~K using the {\tt awk/gawk} command line program is the following:
\begin{verbatim}
awk '{if ($2 == 500) {print $1, $3;}}' < Si_seebeck.dat \

Then, you can plot columns 1 and 2 of the output file \verb#Si_seebeck_xx_500K.dat#.
\item Try to calculate the Seebeck coefficient as a function of the temperature, for a $n-$doped sample with, e.g., $n=10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$. Note that to this aim, you need to calculate consistently the value $\mu(T)$ of the chemical potential as a function of the temperature, so as to reproduce the given value of $n$. Then, you have to write a small program/script to interpolate the output of \bw, that you should have run on a suitable grid of $(\mu,T)$ points.

\section*{17: Iron -- Spin-orbit effects}

Note: You should go through Example 8 (iron without spin-orbit) before
doing this Example.

\begin{itemize}
\item{Outline: \it{Plot the spin-orbit-coupled bands of ferromagnetic
      iron.  Plot the Fermi-surface contours on a plane in the
      Brillouin zone.}}
\item{Directory: {\tt examples/example17/}}
\item{Input files}
\begin{itemize}
\item{ {\tt Fe.scf} {\it The \pwscf\ input file for ground state
    calculation}}
\item{ {\tt Fe.nscf}  {\it The \pwscf\ input file to obtain Bloch
    states on a uniform grid}} 
\item{ {\tt Fe.pw2wan}  {\it The input file for {\tt pw2wannier90}}}
\item{ {\tt Fe.win}  {\it The {\tt wannier90} and {\tt postw90} input file}}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Run \pwscf\ to obtain the ferromagnetic ground state of
  iron\footnote{Please note the following counterintiutive feature in
    {\tt pwscf}: in order to obtain a ground state with magnetization
    along the {\it positive} $z$-axis, one must use a {\it negative}
    value for the variable {\tt starting\_magnetization}.}\\
  {\tt pw.x < Fe.scf > scf.out}

\item Run \pwscf\ to obtain the Bloch states on a uniform k-point
  grid\\ 
{\tt pw.x < Fe.nscf > nscf.out}

\item Run \wannier\ to generate a list of the required overlaps (written
  into the {\tt Fe.nnkp} file).\\
{\tt wannier90.x -pp Fe}

\item Run {\tt pw2wannier90} to compute:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{The overlaps $\langle u_{n{\bf k}}\vert u_{m{\bf k}+{\bf
          b}}\rangle$ between Bloch states (written in the {\tt
        Fe.mmn} file)}
    \item{The projections for the starting guess (written in the {\tt  Fe.amn} file)}
    \item{The spin matrix elements $\langle \psi_{n{\bf k}}\vert
        \sigma_i\vert \psi_{m{\bf k}}\rangle$ (written in the {\tt
          Fe.spn} file)}
%\item{The matrix elements  $\langle u_{n{\bf k}+{\bf b}_1}\vert H_{\bf k}\vert
%u_{m{\bf k}+{\bf

{\tt wannier90.x Fe}

\item Run \postw\ to compute the energy bands and spin expectation value 
by Wannier interpolation.\\
{\tt postw90.x Fe}

\end{enumerate}

 In this example we use the module {\tt kpath} to plot the energy
  bands coloured by the expectation value of the spin along [001]:
  \smallskip {\tt
\begin{quote}
kpath = T

kpath\_task = bands

bands\_color = spin     

kpath\_num\_points=1000

  is not a good quantum number, and intermediate colors occur in the
  vicinity of (avoided) crossings between up- and down-spin bands.}
\label{fig:fe-bnd}
\end{center}

A suitable path is

To plot the spin-colored bandstructure using gnuplot (version 4.2 or
higher), issue \smallskip {\tt

We can also inspect the energy bands across an entire plane, using the
module {\tt kslice}.  In order to evaluate the energy eigenvalues on
the (010) plane in the BZ, uncomment the following ibnstructions in
{\tt Fe.win}, 
\smallskip {\tt
\begin{quote}
kslice = T

kslice\_task = bands

kslice\_num\_points=200

kslice\_corner = 0.0  0.0  0.0

The Fermi contours on the (010) plane can be visualized with the {\tt
  octave} script {\tt bands.m}, 
\smallskip
{\tt
\begin{quote}

or with the {\tt python+pylab+numpy} script {\tt bands.py},

\end{quote} }
\smallskip 




\subsection*{Further ideas}

\begin{itemize}
\item Redraw the Fermi-surface contours on the (010) plane starting
  from an {\it ab initio} calculation without spin-orbit coupling, and
  compare with Fig.~\ref{fig:fe-fermicontours} (bcc Fe without
  spin-orbit was considered in Example~8). Note how the spin-orbit
  interaction changes the connectivity of the Fermi surface.

\section*{18: Iron -- Berry curvature and anomalous Hall 
conductivity}

\begin{itemize}
\item{Outline: \it{Calculate the $k$-space Berry curvature and
      anomalous Hall conductivity by Wannier interpolation, as
      described in Ref.~\cite{wang-prb06}.}}
\item{Directory: {\tt examples/example18/}}
\item{Input files}
\begin{itemize}
\item{ {\tt Fe.scf} {\it The \pwscf\ input file for ground state
    calculation}}
\item{ {\tt Fe.nscf}  {\it The \pwscf\ input file to obtain Bloch
    states on a uniform grid}} 
\item{ {\tt Fe.pw2wan}  {\it The input file for {\tt pw2wannier90}}}
\item{ {\tt Fe.win}  {\it The {\tt wannier90} and {\tt postw90} input file}}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Note the sequence of steps in the following is the same of Example~17.
If you have already run Example~17 you can reuse the output files from
steps 1--5, and only step 6 must be carried out again using the new
input file {\tt Fe.win}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Run \pwscf\ to obtain the ground state of iron\\
{\tt pw.x < Fe.scf > scf.out}

\item Run \pwscf\ to obtain the Bloch states on a uniform k-point
  grid\\ 
{\tt pw.x < Fe.nscf > nscf.out}

\item Run \wannier\ to generate a list of the required overlaps (written
  into the {\tt Fe.nnkp} file).\\
{\tt wannier90.x -pp Fe}

\item Run {\tt pw2wannier90} to compute the overlaps between Bloch
  states and the projections for the starting guess (written in the
  {\tt Si.mmn} and {\tt  Si.amn} files).\\
{\tt pw2wannier90.x < Fe.pw2wan > pw2wan.out}

\item Run \wannier\ to compute the MLWF.\\
{\tt wannier90.x Fe}

\item Run \postw\ to compute the Berry curvature.\\
{\tt postw90.x Fe}

\end{enumerate}

The  Berry curvature of a Bloch state is defined as
$$
\Omega_n^z({\bf k})=-2{\rm Im}
\langle \nabla_{k_x} u_{n{\bf k}}\vert \nabla_{k_y} u_{n{\bf k}}\rangle.
$$
%
We are interested in the Berry curvature summed over the occupied
states,
$$
\Omega^z({\bf k})=\sum_n^{\rm occ}\,\Omega_n^z({\bf k}).
$$
%
The following instructions in {\tt Fe.win} are used to
calculate $-\Omega^z({\bf k})$ along high symmetry lines 
in
$k$-space, 
\smallskip {\tt
\begin{quote}
fermi\_energy = 12.6285

kpath = T

kpath\_task = curv

kpath\_num\_points=1000
\end{quote} }

The path specification in {\tt Fe.win} is the same as in Example~17,
and the value of the Fermi energy, 12.6285~eV, was taken from {\tt
  scf.out}. {\bf [[Check: does it change with the new pseudopotential?]}

Carry out the calculation by executing {\tt postw90} (step 6 above),
plot the Berry curvature using the {\tt gnuplot} script {\tt
  Fe\_curv.gnu}, \smallskip {\tt
\begin{quote}
myshell> gnuplot

gnuplot> load `Fe\_curv.gnu'
\end{quote} }

and compare with the lower panel in Fig.~2 of Ref.~\cite{yao-prl04}.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:fe-fermicontours} of Example~17 we plotted the Fermi
contours on the (010) plane in $k$-space. 
If in addition we want to
visualize the Berry curvature across the plane, we uncomment the following
instructions in {\tt Fe.win}, 
\smallskip {\tt
\begin{quote}
kslice = T

kslice\_task = bands+curv

kslice\_num\_points=200

kslice\_corner = 0.0  0.0  0.0

kslice\_b1 =     0.5 -0.5 -0.5

kslice\_b2 =     0.5  0.5  0.5
\end{quote} }

and re-run {\tt postw90}.  For the visualization we use the {\tt
  python+pylab+numpy} script {\tt curvbands.py}, 
\smallskip {\tt
\begin{quote}
myshell> python curvbands.py
\end{quote} }

which generates a heatmap plot of the Berry curvature (compare with
Fig.~3 in Ref.~\cite{yao-prl04}).

The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) is proportional to the
integral of the Berry curvature over the entire Brillouin zone. For
bcc Fe with the magnetization along [001], the only nonzero components
of the AHC tensor $\sigma_{\alpha\beta}$ are
$\sigma_{xy}=-\sigma_{yx}$.  In order to evaluate $\sigma_{xy}$ by
integrating $-\Omega^z({\bf k})$ over a $25\times 25\times 25$
$k$-point mesh, we uncomment the following lines in {\tt Fe.win},
\smallskip {\tt
\begin{quote}
berry = T

berry\_task = ahc                

alpha = 1                       

beta = 2

berry\_interp\_mesh = 25 25 25

\end{quote} } 
\smallskip 

and re-run {\tt postw90}.  The AHC is given in the output file {\tt Fe.wpout} in
units of S/cm .

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\scalebox{0.5}{\includegraphics{Fe_curvbands}}
\caption{Berry curvature $-\Omega^z({\bf k})$ on the (010) plane of
  bcc Fe, in atomic units.  The color scale is as follows:
  a positive value, e.g., 2, means $10^2$~bohr$^2$, while a negative value,
  e.g., -2, means $-10^2$~bohr$^2$.}
\label{fig:fe-curv-slice}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Further ideas}

\begin{itemize}
\item Study the convergence of the AHC with respect to the density of
  the integration mesh by progressively increasing the value of the
  parameter {\tt berry\_interp\_mesh}.

\item Instead of simply increasing the mesh density uniformly across
  the BZ, it is more efficient to adaptively refine the mesh in
  regions where the Berry curvature is large and rapidly varying (see
  Fig.~\ref{fig:fe-curv-slice}).  Add to {\tt Fe.win} the lines
  \smallskip {\tt
\begin{quote}
berry\_adaptive\_mesh = 5  

berry\_adaptive\_thresh = 27.98
\end{quote} }
\smallskip

in order to add a $5\times 5\times 5$ fine grid around those points
where $\vert\Omega^z({\bf k})\vert$ exceeds 27.98~\AA$^2\simeq
100$~bohr$^2$. The percentage of points on the uniform mesh triggering
adaptive refinement is given in {\tt Fe.wpout}.

\item Compare the converged value for the AHC with the values reported
in Refs.~\cite{wang-prb06} and~\cite{yao-prl04}.
