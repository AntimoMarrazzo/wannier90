To run the examples, follow the instructions in the
Wannier90 Tutorial, which may be found in the 'doc'
directory of the Wannier90 distribution.

The examples are as follows:

Examples with A and M matrices provided
---------------------------------------

example1: Gallium Arsenide, valence bands

example2: Lead, 4 lowest states; Fermi surface

example3: Silicon, 4 valence bands + 4 conduction bands;
          interpolated bandstructure

example4: Copper, states around the Fermi level; Fermi surface

Examples that use the pw2wannier90 interface with PWSCF
-------------------------------------------------------

example5: Diamond, valence states

example6: Copper, states around the Fermi level; Fermi surface

example7: Silane, valence states

example8: Iron, states around the Fermi level
