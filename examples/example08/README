WANNIER90 Calculation for bcc iron

to run

pw.x < iron.scf > scf.out
pw.x < iron.nscf > nscf.out

for spin_up

wannier90.x -pp iron_up
pw2wannier90.x < iron_up.pw2wan > pw2wan_up.out
wannier90.x iron_up

for spin_down

wannier90.x -pp iron_dn
pw2wannier90.x < iron_dn.pw2wan > pw2wan_dn.out     
wannier90.x iron_dn


NOTE: as this calculation does not include spin-orbit
coupling we compute the WF for spin up and spin down
is seperate calculations
(ie all operators are diagonal in spin)
