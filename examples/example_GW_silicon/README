##G0W0 bands of silicon##
#########################
Steps:
-Run a SCF calculation: silicon.scf
-Run a NSCF calculation on 8x8x8 reduced grid with many bands needed for GW: silicon.gw.nscf
-Use the mesh_mapper.py utility to find the indeces of a 4x4x4 grid into the 8x8x8 grid given to GW.
-Run p2y
-Run a GW calculation (using a 8x8x8 grid but computing QP corrections only on a 4x4x4 grid): yambo.in
-Run ypp: ypp.in
-Run a NSCF calculation on 4x4x4 uniform grid with few bands needed for Wannier90: silicon.nscf
-Run Wannier90 -pp, pw2wannier90, Wannier90: silicon.win # Now look at the interpolated bands at the DFT level
-Run the gw2wannier90.py script to reored, align and correct all matrices and files using the QP corrections:
-Run Wannier90 -pp, pw2wannier90, Wannier90: silicon.gw.win # Now look a the interpolated bands at the GW level

Do this chain of steps first for the valence bands only (4 Wannier functions) and then also for the lower lying conduction bands (8 Wannier functions).
