To run the wannier code in post-processing mode:

1. Edit wannier.in, setting kmesh_setup = .true.

2. Run the code
   $ wannier90.x &

3. Execution will stop when the file wannier.nnkp is written[3]
   This file provides information as regards which overlaps
   M_mn(k,b) are required -- see MV[1] Eq.(25)

4. Compute M_mn(k,b) and A_mn(k) -- SMV[2] Eq.(22) -- using your 
   favourite code (probably PWSCF), writing them to files 
   wannier.mmn and wannier.amn, respectively, in the required format[3]

5. Edit wannier.in, setting kmesh_setup = .false.

6. Run the code
   $ wannier90.x &

7. The output is written to wannier.out

8. Voila!
