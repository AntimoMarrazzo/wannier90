 The Maximally-Localised Generalised Wannier Functions Code 

v1.0.3 (1st Sep 2007)

* Addition of specific algorithms for when only Gamma-point 
  sampling is used (new input variable: gamma_only)
* Option to write out hamiltonian matrix elements in the Wannier 
  function basis (new input variables: h_plot,ham_r_max)
* Option to set a convergence threshold for localisation procedure
  (new input variables: conv_tol, conv_window)
* Improved minimisation algorithms for localisation routines
  (new input variables: conv_noise_amp, conv_noise_num)
* Option to specify the number of shells that are searched to find
  nearest neighbour b-vectors (new input variable: search_shells)
* Option to plot bandstructures in xmgrace format (bands_plot_format=xmgrace)
* Option to plot Wannier functions in cube format (wannier_plot_format=cube) 
  -- works for isolated molecules, further testing for periodic systems is 
  required -- significantly reduced WF file-size  
  (new input variable: wannier_plot_radius) 


v1.0.2 (1st Dec 2006)

* Addition of "library mode" functionality
* Introduction of "range vectors" for specifying exclude_bands and 
  wannier_plot_list in input file
* Option to specify random projections
* Option to use Bloch phases for initial projections
* Addition of timing_level input flag to control how much timing
  information is outputted
* Option to translate final centres to the home unit cell
* Option to write final centres in xyz format
* Acceleration of disentanglement procedure
* Speed-up of localisation routines
* Improved robustness of plotting routines

v1.0.1 (17th May 2006)

* Bug fix in wannierise minimiser - caused poor convergence in large systems
* Increase precision of k-points in *.nnkp file
* More robust selection of eigenvectors in disentanglement (dis_proj_froz)
* Addition of write_proj keyword -- outputs projection of original bands 
  on final Wannier functions
* Longer strings for atom labels in *.win
* Minor format change to *_bands.dat
* Check restart keyword in *.win
