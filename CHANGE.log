 The Maximally-Localised Generalised Wannier Functions Code 

v1.0.2 (1st Dec 2006)

* Addition of "library mode" functionality
* Introduction of "range vectors" for specifying exclude_bands and 
  wannier_plot_list in input file
* Option to specify random projections
* Option to use Bloch phases for initial projections
* Addition of timing_level input flag to control how much timing
  information is outputted
* Option to translate final centres to the home unit cell
* Option to write final centres in xyz format
* Acceleration of disentanglement procedure
* Speed-up of localisation routines
* Improved robustness of plotting routines

v1.0.1 (17th May 2006)

* Bug fix in wannierise minimiser - caused poor convergence in large systems
* Increase precision of k-points in *.nnkp file
* More robust selection of eigenvectors in disentanglement (dis_proj_froz)
* Addition of write_proj keyword -- outputs projection of original bands 
  on final Wannier functions
* Longer strings for atom labels in *.win
* Minor format change to *_bands.dat
* Check restart keyword in *.win
