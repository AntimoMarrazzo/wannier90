 The Maximally-Localised Generalised Wannier Functions Code 

v1.0.1 (17th May 2006)

* Bug fix in wannierise minimiser - caused poor convergence in large systems
* Increase precision of k-points in *.nnkp file
* More robust selection of eigenvectors in disentanglement (dis_proj_froz)
* Addition of write_proj keyword -- outputs projection of original bands 
  on final Wannier functions
* Longer strings for atom labels in *.win
* Minor format change to *_bands.dat
