Things for the next (2.1) release
+ Testsuite (AAM) 
+ Plotting (atom-centred grids) (AAM) 
+ Update ballistic transport (AAM)
+ Jmol interface (JRY) 
+ Parallel timing routines (ALL) [maybe for 2.0 we should just check that 
  the current parallel timing provides results that make sense]
+ Improve adaptive smearing (GP) (see if the adaptive k-mesh implemented in BoltzWann works correctly)
+ BoltzWann: use scissor operator of Ivo
+ Fermi_energy finding routine (re-introduce input var num_elec_cell, make
it real, for, e.g., alloys in VCA, make found_fermi_energy work) (IS)
+ Compute Wannier occupations (see email correspondence on 2013-04-03)
+ Consolidate  hamiltonian_wigner_seitz and wigner_seitz in postw90_common?
+ Use scissor operator for bandstructures (JRY / IS)
+ commandline help (JRY)
+ Improve the output of projection only WF (eg initial spread) 
+ Command-line option to check input file and
  stop with result after reading parameters and finding b-vectors (eg,
  -validate) (GP) [see help above - be aware of MPICH adding arguments to the command line]
