Upcoming release:
+ Duplication of "Fermi energy" variable (AAM)
+ Minimum k-spacing (debug only) (JRY)
+ Projection-only WFs (document, improve output) (JRY)
+ AHE/Orb-Mag - keywords, documentation, examples (IS)
+ Update documentation: input variables, FAQ, credits, version number, 
                        CHANGE.LOG, installation instructions (ALL)
  * I have a parser that lists all variables in the code (GP)
+ Update checks on parameters (ALL)  
  * update param_write with new params
  * Check if in DOS, berry, etc. we are correctly using num_elec_per_state (or, if the routine assumes num_elec_per_state=1, if this is checked at the beginning)
+ pw2wannier90 (JRY, IS)



And to postpone to 2.1: 
+ Testsuite (AAM) 
+ Plotting (atom-centred grids, POVRay) (AAM) 
+ Command-line option to check input file and
  stop with result after reading parameters and finding b-vectors (eg,
  -validate) (GP) 
+ Jmol interface (JRY) 
+ Parallel timing routines (ALL) [maybe for 2.0 we should just check that 
  the current parallel timing provides results that make sense]
+ improvement: supercell for real-space wannier function plot with different size on different axes (see David Strubbe's mail/patches) (GP)
+ Improve adaptive smearing (GP) (see if the adaptive k-mesh implemented in BoltzWann works correctly)




To discuss:
+ Parity issue in pw2wan90 in spin-polarized, Gamma-only branch (AAM) 
  [if it is a bug fix probably it should be done for 2.0]
+ Update ballistic transport (AAM) [if it is just moving the code to 
  postw90.x, it should be done for 2.0]
+ Spinor projections (JRY) [I don't know/remember if/how much this is urgent]
+ Scissors operator: input variables, call from Boltzwann
