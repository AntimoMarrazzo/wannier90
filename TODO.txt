Deadlines:
* Oct. 25th: main modifications + documentation
* Nov. 11th: get feedback and prepare pre-release

Upcoming release:
+ Add own changes on the CHANGE.log (ALL)
+ Duplication of "Fermi energy" variable (AAM) ***DONE BY IVO***
+ Minimum k-spacing (debug only) (JRY)
+ Projection-only WFs (document, improve output, use in Example08) (JRY)
+ AHE/Orb-Mag - keywords, documentation, examples (IS)
+ Update documentation: input variables, FAQ, credits, version number, 
                        CHANGE.LOG, installation instructions (ALL)
  * I have a parser that lists all variables in the code (GP)
+ Update checks on parameters (ALL)  
  * update param_write with new params (ALL)
  * Check if in DOS, berry, etc. we are correctly using num_elec_per_state (or, if the routine assumes num_elec_per_state=1, if this is checked at the beginning) (ALL) [Ivo: forced num_elec_per_state=1 when spinors = T]
+ POVRay plotting (AAM) ***DONE***
+ Fix in pw2w90 for spin-polarized systems when write_parity=true (AAM) ***DONE***  
+ Command-line option to check input file and
  stop with result after reading parameters and finding b-vectors (eg,
  -validate) (GP) 
+ Scissors operator: input variables (IS) ***DONE***

And to postpone to 2.1: 
+ Testsuite (AAM) 
+ Plotting (atom-centred grids) (AAM) 
+ Update ballistic transport (AAM)
+ Jmol interface (JRY) 
+ Parallel timing routines (ALL) [maybe for 2.0 we should just check that 
  the current parallel timing provides results that make sense]
+ Improve adaptive smearing (GP) (see if the adaptive k-mesh implemented in BoltzWann works correctly)
+ BoltzWann: use scissor operator of Ivo
+ Fermi_energy finding routine (re-introduce input var num_elec_cell, make
it real, for, e.g., alloys in VCA, make found_fermi_energy work) (IS)
+ Compute Wannier occupations (see email correspondence on 2013-04-03)
+ Consolidate  hamiltonian_wigner_seitz and wigner_seitz in postw90_common?
