+ Duplication of "Fermi energy" variable (AAM)
+ chk2chk utility (GP) [it's just to move it in the utility directory]
+ Minimum k-spacing (debug only) (JRY)
+ Projection-only WFs (document, improve output) (JRY)
+ AHE/Orb-Mag - keywords, documentation, examples (IS)
+ Merge dos_kpt, spin_decomp (GP)
+ Update documentation: input variables, FAQ, credits, version number, 
                        CHANGE.LOG, installation instructions (ALL)
+ Update checks on parameters (ALL)

And to postpone to 2.1: 
+ Testsuite (AAM) 
+ Plotting (atom-centred grids, POVRay) (AAM) 
+ Command-line option to check input file and
  stop with result after reading parameters and finding b-vectors (eg,
  -validate) (GP) 
+ Jmol interface (JRY) 
+ Parallel timing routines (ALL) [maybe for 2.0 we should just check that 
  the current parallel timing provides results that make sense]

While for the following I do not know, either because I do not
remember exactly what they were, or because I am not sure if we need
to do them now; see comments below:

+ Parity issue in pw2wan90 in spin-polarized, Gamma-only branch (AAM) 
  [if it is a bug fix probably it should be done for 2.0]
+ Update ballistic transport (AAM) [if it is just moving the code to 
  postw90.x, it should be done for 2.0]
+ Improve adaptive smearing (GP) [I have to read again my previous mails
  with the results of my tests; probably, there is something that can be 
  done for 2.0, and possibly further improvements can be done in 2.1]
+ PDOS (JRY) [I don't know/remember if/how much this is urgent] ***DONE***
+ Spinor projections (JRY)Â [I don't know/remember if/how much this is urgent]
+ Scissors operator: input variables, call from Boltzwann
